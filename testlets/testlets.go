// NOTE
//
// Early efforts to build native-Go testlets involved the embedding of testlet logic into the
// ToDD agent itself. As a result, it was important to build some reusable infrastructure so that goroutines
// running testlet code within the agent could be controlled, and that new testlets could benefit from this
// infrastructure.
//
// Since then, the decision was made to keep testlets as their own separate binaries.
//
// These testlets are in their own repositories, and they do actually use some of the logic below, just not as meaningfully
// and comprehensively as they would have if they were baked in to the agent.  The development standard for all "blessed"
// testlets will still ensure that they use this interface, so that if we decide to bake them into the agent in the future,
// they'll already conform.
//
// (The vast majority of this code was inspired by the database drivers implementation in the stdlib)
